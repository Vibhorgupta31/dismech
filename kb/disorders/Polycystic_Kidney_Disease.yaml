category: Mendelian
description: >
  Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the
  development of multiple fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. The autosomal dominant
  form (ADPKD) is one of the most common inherited kidney diseases, affecting
  approximately 1 in 500-1000 people. ADPKD is caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2
  genes and typically presents in adulthood with progressive renal enlargement,
  hypertension, and eventual kidney failure. Autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD) is
  less common and typically presents in infancy or childhood.

pathophysiology:
  - name: Cystogenesis
    description: >
      Cyst formation results from defective polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2)
      signaling. These proteins localize to primary cilia and regulate intracellular
      calcium signaling, cell proliferation, and fluid secretion. Disruption leads
      to aberrant cell proliferation and fluid accumulation forming cysts.

  - name: Ciliary Dysfunction
    description: >
      Primary cilia act as mechanosensors in renal tubular epithelial cells.
      Polycystin dysfunction impairs ciliary signaling, disrupting normal tubular
      architecture and promoting cyst formation through increased cAMP signaling.
