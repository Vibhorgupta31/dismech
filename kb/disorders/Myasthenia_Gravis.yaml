description: >-
  An autoimmune neuromuscular disease caused by antibodies against the
  acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or related proteins at the neuromuscular
  junction. Characterized by fatigable muscle weakness that worsens with
  activity and improves with rest.
pathophysiology:
- name: Anti-AChR Antibody-Mediated Receptor Loss
  description: >-
    Autoantibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor cause receptor
    loss through complement-mediated destruction, accelerated internalization,
    and functional blockade. This reduces the safety factor for neuromuscular
    transmission.

      Acetylcholine receptor antibodies induce neuromuscular transmission defect
      by various potential mechanisms including internalisation of AChR, receptor
      blockade and by activation of the classical complement pathway. Membrane attack
      complex (MAC) which is the final end product of complement activation leads
      to architectural destruction of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).
    explanation: >-
      This review demonstrates that AChR antibodies cause disease through three
      established mechanisms: complement-mediated MAC formation, receptor internalization,
      and direct blockade, all contributing to NMJ destruction.

    snippet: >-
      Complement activation is one of the mechanisms by which anti-acetylcholine
      receptor (anti-AChR) autoantibodies reduce synaptic transmission at the NMJ.
    explanation: >-
      This study provides direct biochemical evidence for classical complement
      pathway activation in AChR-positive MG patients, demonstrating elevated
      membrane attack complex levels correlating with disease activity.
- name: Thymic Abnormalities
  description: >-
    Thymic hyperplasia with germinal centers is present in most early-onset
    MG patients, while thymoma occurs in 10-15% of cases. The thymus may be
    the site of autoimmunization against AChR.

    snippet: >-
      The presence of anti-AChR antibodies is correlated with the degree of
      follicular hyperplasia, suggesting that the thymus is a source of anti-AChR
      antibodies.
    explanation: >-
      This large study of 1035 MG patients demonstrates that thymic germinal
      center formation is strongly associated with anti-AChR antibody production,
      supporting the thymus as a primary site of autoimmunization in early-onset MG.

    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: >-
      The thymus is clearly involved in the pathogenesis of early-onset MG with
      anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, and thymic hyperplasia of
      lympho-proliferative origin is a hallmark of the disease. In this review,
      we describe the structural and cellular changes associated with thymic
      hyperplasia, its main characteristics being the development of ectopic
      germinal centers (GCs) associated with active neoangiogenic processes.
    explanation: >-
      This review establishes ectopic germinal center formation and thymic
      remodeling as key pathological features in early-onset MG, explaining the
      mechanism by which the thymus drives autoantibody production.
- name: MuSK Antibody-Mediated Disease
  description: >-
    In AChR-negative patients, antibodies against muscle-specific kinase (MuSK)
    disrupt AChR clustering at the neuromuscular junction. MuSK-MG has distinct
    clinical features with prominent bulbar and respiratory involvement.

      MuSK IgG, Fab fragments and IgG4 inhibited the binding of LRP4 to MuSK and
      reduced agrin-induced AChR clustering in C2C12 cells.
    explanation: >-
      This study demonstrates that MuSK antibodies, particularly IgG4, disrupt
      the LRP4-MuSK interaction essential for AChR clustering, explaining the
      pathogenic mechanism in MuSK-positive MG patients.

    snippet: >-
      Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the most common disorder affecting the
      neuromuscular junction (NMJ). MG is frequently caused by autoantibodies
      against acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and a kinase critical for NMJ
      formation, MuSK.
    explanation: >-
      This landmark study establishes MuSK as a critical target autoantigen in
      AChR-negative MG, demonstrating that anti-MuSK antibodies induce MG-like
      symptoms through disruption of neuromuscular junction formation and
      maintenance.

      The main pathogenic mechanism of MG is the activation of the complement

      antibodies directly causes the hallmark fatigable weakness by reducing the

      Approximately 50% of the tested sera specifically bound to HEK293 cells
      transfected with human LRP4. Moreover, 4 out of these 13 sera inhibited
      agrin-induced aggregation of AChRs in cultured myotubes by more than 50%,
      suggesting a pathogenic role regarding the dysfunction of the neuromuscular
      endplate.
    explanation: >-
      This study identifies LRP4 as a novel autoantibody target in seronegative
      MG patients, demonstrating that anti-LRP4 antibodies can inhibit AChR
      clustering and serve as a diagnostic marker in double-seronegative patients.
