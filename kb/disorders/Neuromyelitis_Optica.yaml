description: >-
  Neuromyelitis optica is an autoimmune astrocytopathy characterized by
  aquaporin-4 (AQP4) autoantibody-mediated injury to astrocytes and secondary
  demyelination.
pathophysiology:
- name: AQP4-IgG-Mediated Astrocyte Injury
  description: >-
    Autoantibodies against AQP4 bind astrocytic end-feet and trigger
    complement-dependent astrocyte damage, driving neuroinflammation.
  cell_types:
  - preferred_term: astrocyte
    term:
      id: CL:0000127
      label: astrocyte
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: complement activation
    modifier: INCREASED
    term:
      id: GO:0006956
      label: complement activation
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:35454180
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "In NMOSD, the autoantibody (NMO-IgG) binds to the extracellular loops of AQP4 as expressed in perivascular astrocytic end-feet and disrupts astrocytes in a complement-dependent manner."
    explanation: The abstract describes AQP4-IgG binding and complement-mediated astrocyte disruption.
- name: AQP4 Endocytosis and Complement-Independent Cytotoxicity
  description: >-
    NMO-IgG can induce complement-independent astrocyte injury, with antibody-
    induced endocytosis of AQP4 implicated in this mechanism.
  biological_processes:
  - preferred_term: endocytosis
    modifier: INCREASED
    term:
      id: GO:0006897
      label: endocytosis
  evidence:
  - reference: PMID:35454180
    supports: SUPPORT
    snippet: "Recent studies have also demonstrated complement-independent cytotoxic effects of NMO-IgG. Antibody-induced endocytosis of AQP4 has been suggested to be involved in this mechanism."
    explanation: The abstract notes complement-independent cytotoxicity and AQP4 endocytosis in NMOSD.
