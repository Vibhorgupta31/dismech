name: Retrograde Cricopharyngeus Dysfunction
description: A syndrome characterized by the inability to belch due to failure of the upper esophageal sphincter (cricopharyngeus muscle) to relax in response to retrograde esophageal gaseous distension. The associated symptom complex includes abdominal bloating, chest pain, gurgling noises in the chest, nausea, and excessive flatulence.

pathophysiology:
- name: Failure of Upper Esophageal Sphincter Relaxation
  description: The cricopharyngeus muscle, which constitutes the upper esophageal sphincter, fails to relax in response to retrograde esophageal gaseous distension that normally triggers belching. This is a reflex-specific deficit, as deglutitive (swallowing-related) UES relaxation remains intact.

notes: >
  R-CPD was first formally described as a clinical entity in 2019 by Bastian and Smithson.
  Prior to this, only three case reports existed in the literature of individuals with
  physiologically demonstrated inability to belch. The condition is now recognized as
  more common than previously thought. Many patients retain the ability to belch after
  botulinum toxin treatment beyond the expected pharmacologic duration, suggesting
  reflex reprogramming or central adaptation may occur.
