pathophysiology:
  - name: HFE-mediated Iron Overload
    description: >
      Mutations in the HFE gene (most commonly C282Y) impair hepcidin regulation, leading
      to inappropriately low hepcidin levels. This causes excessive iron absorption from
      the intestine via unregulated ferroportin activity, resulting in systemic iron
      overload that deposits in parenchymal tissues.

      - reference: PMID:23985001
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: "Hereditary hemochromatosis is an inherited iron overload disorder caused by inappropriately low hepcidin secretion leading to increased duodenal absorption of dietary iron, most commonly in C282Y homozygous individuals."
        explanation: "This review describes the core pathophysiology of hereditary hemochromatosis involving impaired hepcidin regulation and increased iron absorption."
