name: Lyme Disease
category: Infectious
description: >
  Lyme disease is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi
  and related Borrelia species. It is the most common vector-borne disease in
  North America and Europe. The disease progresses through stages: early localized
  (erythema migrans), early disseminated (multiple erythema migrans, neurological,
  cardiac involvement), and late disseminated (arthritis, chronic neurological).
  Early antibiotic treatment is highly effective, while delayed treatment may lead
  to persistent symptoms.

    description: Months to years after infection, characterized by Lyme arthritis or chronic neurological manifestations.
  - name: Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome
    description: Persistent symptoms after appropriate antibiotic therapy, occurring in 10-20% of treated patients.
pathophysiology:
  - name: Spirochete Invasion and Dissemination
    description: >
      Borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted through Ixodes tick bites. The spirochete
      disseminates from the skin through the bloodstream to multiple organ systems
      including joints, heart, and nervous system. Surface adhesins like BBK32 and
      decorin-binding proteins (DbpA/DbpB) facilitate tissue colonization.

  - name: Immune Evasion via Complement Inhibition
    description: >
      Borrelia employs multiple strategies to evade host immunity, including
      complement evasion through CRASPs (complement regulator-acquiring surface
      proteins), antigenic variation of VlsE, and interference with antibody-mediated
      killing. BBK32 inhibits the classical complement pathway by binding C1r.

  - name: Inflammatory Response and Tissue Damage
    description: >
      The host immune response to Borrelia antigens contributes to tissue damage.
      Spirochetal lipoproteins and peptidoglycan trigger robust innate immune
      activation with production of IL-6, IL-8, TNF, and chemokines (CCL3/CCL4).
      Persistent inflammation in joints may continue even after spirochete clearance.
