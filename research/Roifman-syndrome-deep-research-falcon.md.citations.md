Focus on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying disease progression.

### Required Information

#### 1. Core Pathophysiology
- What are the primary pathophysiological mechanisms?
- What molecular pathways are dysregulated?
- What cellular processes are affected?

#### 2. Key Molecular Players
- **Genes/Proteins**: Which genes are causally involved or implicated?
- **Chemical Entities**: What metabolites, drugs, or small molecules are relevant?
- **Cell Types**: Which cell types are primarily affected?
- **Anatomical Locations**: Which tissues/organs are involved?

#### 3. Biological Processes (for GO annotation)
- What biological processes (GO terms) are disrupted?
- Consider: signaling pathways, metabolic processes, cellular responses, transport, etc.

#### 4. Cellular Components
- Where in the cell do key processes occur?
- Consider: organelles, membrane compartments, extracellular space, etc.

#### 5. Disease Progression
- What is the sequence of events from initial trigger to clinical manifestation?
- Are there distinct stages or phases?

#### 6. Phenotypic Manifestations
- What are the key clinical phenotypes?
- How do they relate to the underlying mechanisms?

### Citation Requirements
